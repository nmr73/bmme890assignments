#I have access to a virtual machine, have git working, but for some reason anaconda isn't downloading properly within the virtual machine, I've been working off of it in windows temporarily. Collaborators should have access to this repository now.

#I initially polled that I have access to GPU. My University desktop computer (Windows) blocks me from installing any kind of virtual machine, and there is no access within the BIOS to change settings to prevent this block. Because of this I have to work off laptop unfortunately and do not have access to GPU.
