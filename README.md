# bmme_890_Rubin

HW 1:
I've successfully installed all software within Linux Virtual Machine (no GPU) now on desktop. Collaborators should have access to this repository now.

HW 2A:
Complete. Had some trouble with setting indexing initially for the data frame and setting an array for survived followed by editing a specific row. Otherwise, no issues.

HW 2B:
Complete.

HW 4: Did not have time to do grid search/randomized search, explored multiple algorithms.

HW 5: Majority of time was spent performing preprocessing. Lots of troubleshooting to get training/test sets to have same proper features. Feature engineering was difficult to conduct with 50+ potentials. Tried many algorithms with randomized/grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

HW 6: Explored various thresholds, conducted PCA, visualized first 2 components, clustered into 3 neurons and displayed average waveform. Was not sure how to conduct a fair goodness of fit to determine whether a threshold for spike detection was appropriate.
